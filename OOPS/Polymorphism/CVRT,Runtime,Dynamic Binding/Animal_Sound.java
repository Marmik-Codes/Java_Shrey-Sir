// Scenario 1: Animal Sounds
// In an animal sounds application, create a base class called "Animal" with a method called "makeSound" that returns an instance of the "Sound" class. Implement derived classes like "Dog" and "Cat" that override the "makeSound" method and return their specific sound objects.

class Animal{
    
}
public class Animal_Sound {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}
